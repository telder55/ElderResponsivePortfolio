# ElderResponsivePortfolio

This project serves as a working portfolio for my current and future web development work. THere are a total of four pages on this website, "About Me" which serves as the homepage, "Portolio" which links to the various projects I have done and will be updated as I complete future projects, "Contact" which has a form set up to get in touch with me. The contact form will become functional in future updates to the project. The fourth page is "Cheesy Puffs Game" where users can play a simple game that I coded in scratch (desktop only).
